    Class representing a scaffold network.

    Explore scaffold-space through the iterative removal of available rings,

    The output is a directed acyclic graph of molecular scaffolds.

    Class representing a HierS type scaffold network.

    Notes
    -----
    A HierS type network differs from a conventional scaffold network, through construction.
    When fragmenting molecules the HierS constructor does not attempt to break fused ring
    systems.
